{"_id":"3BXWgUvNW1uDvrgU","name":"Crafting Magical Items","content":"<p>Magic-users who wish to create their own magical items will find the following rules useful. In order to create a magical item, a spellcaster must have the @Item[ftkoblrgW8Ze16Fp]{Artificer} exploit.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, you must begin with an exceptional or better quality item. The magic-user might buy such an item or have a skilled craftsman make it. This must be a genuine item, not one magically created.</li>\n<li>The magic-user then casts the desired spell into the item. The stored spell will be usable once per day; this can be increased to three times per day by adding +2 MP to the cost of the spell, or the spell can be made usable at-will by adding +5 MP.</li>\n<li>The total cost of making the item, including components and other resources, is calculated by using the market value formula (1,000 gc times the square of the spell's MP total), but if the magic-user is creating it herself, the cost is halved.</li>\n<li>The time required to enchant the item is one day per MP.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example, if Augusto the Enchanter wished to create a pair of boots which the wearer can click together to gain +4 Speed, the process would look like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Augusto purchases a pair of exceptional quality boots for 255 gc.</li>\n<li>He then casts a 7 MP spell into the boots for +4 Speed using the @JournalEntry[fbfEUURemEt3UXAX]{Movement}/Speed enhancement and the 3 MP duration.</li>\n<li>The cost of the spellcasting is 24,500 gc, and the base cost of the exceptional quality boots is 255 gc, bringing the total cost to 24755 gc.</li>\n<li>It takes Augusto seven days to enchant the boots.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The result is <em>Augusto's Marvelous Accelerating Footwear</em>, a pair of boots which the wearer can click together at any time (one action) to gain +4 Speed for one minute. The boots cost 24,755 gc to create, and would have a value of 49,255 gc on the market if the character were to buy them instead.</p>\n<h3>Selling Items</h3>\n<p>Characters can sell items for half their market value, as usual. Some exploits and skills allow chracters to adjust that sale value. In the case of character-created items, half teh market value is less than the cost to create the item, meaning that going into business creating and selling magic items is not usually feasible--that's why there are no magic item supermarkets.</p>","folder":"0yfBEYzOgvoOjUQm","sort":400000,"permission":{"default":0,"7cKe5J9HEZ26Q640":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"4R9hhawGVCToCqpc","name":"Create","content":"<p><strong>Secrets:</strong> [element]</p>\n<p>Creation spells let you make objects or energy out of nothing. You cannot create creatures, and any energy you create is no more damaging than the weakest evocation, but many other effects are possible.</p>\n<p>The specifics of your creation spell is up to you and your Game Master to decide. Does a creation spell summon objects from other dimensions, or does it create objects whole cloth? When the spell ends, does the object just vanish, or dissolve into mist, or perhaps burst into hundreds of skittering insects that disappear into the nearest nooks and crannies?</p>\n<p>When you create weapons or clothes, you can create them in the hands or on the bodies of willing subjects; you cannot force them to appear on the unwilling.</p>\n<p>At the end of the spell's duration, the object you created goes away entirely. If you make nails and use them to hold up a painting, the nails will vanish when the spell ends, and the painting will fall. Created dirt and mud that soils clothing will leave the clothes clean when the spell ends. If you create water and boil pasta in it, when the spell ends teh water will disappear from the pasta and leave it dry.</p>\n<p>Created materials always have some special \"air\" about them that make them seem unnatural. This is not enough to make people or animals uneasy, but an experienced person can easily determine that an item is magically created.</p>\n<p>As a restriction of the rules, you cannot use a creation spell as a directly offensive spell that is unavoidable: you cannot create a metal block over a creature that will unavoidably crush it--the creature will be granted at least a roll to get out of the way.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A <em>create</em> cantrip can create a tiny object worth no more than 5 gc which lasts for up to one round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Also as a general guideline, you can never create something (like lava) inside a creature, nor can you create something if it would displace solid matter; you can only create objects in air, water, or other fluids. If you want a spell that injures by creating things inside a creature, choose an evocation effect.</p>\n<p>It is still possible to create hazardous things, like flames, lava, or a vacuum, but usually creatures can escape such substances quickly. Higher level spells can trap creatures in a hazardous area.</p>\n<p>Regardless of what specific enhancements you get for a creation spell, the total MP spent on a creation spell also determines the maximum monetary value of item you can create--300 gc per MP spent (round up). This monetary value refers to both craftsmanship and materials. For example, a suit of armor that costs 2000 gc normally would need at least 7 MP.</p>\n<p><strong>Create Object. <em>Cost varies. </em></strong>You can create almost any object. The basic cost of a creation depends on its size, determined by the area of effect of the spell, and the value (in other words, you just pay for the area; you don't need to pay for the object itself). If you don't buy any area of effect, you can create objects no larger than a human-sized longsword or a set of clothes. While the majority of the object must match the secret (create stone, create wood, etc.), minor elements (about 10%) can be of materials to which you do not possess the secret. Thus a set of clothing can have metal buttons, or a stone buiding can have wooden doors.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Object.<em> Cost varies.</em></strong> You can create an object out of elemental force rather than actual matter. This enhancement simply doubles the basic cost of the creation's area. The object is solid, but can take any form you want. If used to create a weapon, the weapon does elemental damage of the appropriate type (fire, cold, etc.) If used to create some other type of object, there may be other effects, detailed in the entry for each element. You can always safely handle objeccts you create yourself, but others can be harmed if they try to walk on a bridge made of fire. Elemental objects are considered to be steel for the purposes of determining their statistics, but they weigh one hundredth of the weight an equivalent steel object would weigh.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Damage. <em>Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> For elements which cause damage (acid, fire, ice, lava, lightning) you can increase the normal 1 damage to 1d6 for 1 MP. For more damage, you need to use evocation enhancements. Choose an element for which you know the secret.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Acid. </strong></em>Elemental objects of acid are mild, and deal 1 point of acid damage per round to anyone who touches them. Stronger acid is not available as a creation. If you want to hurt things with acid, see the section on evocations.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Air.</strong></em> When you create air, you can choose its temperature, between extremes of -40 and 150 degrees Farenheit (-40 and 65 degrees Celsius). Severe heat and cold cannot be used offensively unless you have a way to keep someone from moving out of the area of effect, since it takes a while to die of exposure. The air in the area can be breathed for the duration; if a creature is the target, the spell enables them to breathe fresh air for the duration. For an additional 1 MP, a moderate wind of up to 20 mph can be created. For 2 MP, the wind is strong (up to 50 mph), and for 5 MP it is a hurricane of over 100 mph. For 8 MP a tornado with winds of up to 300 mph can be created.</p>\n<p>This enhancement can also be used to create a type of weather within the area of effect natural to the local climate and season which takes 10 minutes to develop, and fades when the spell's duration ends. The duration must be at least 10 minutes to use it in this manner, but the area cost is one-quarter normal (round down).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fire. </strong></em>Elemental objects created of fire deal 1 point of damage per round to anyone who touches them (normal fire deals 1d6 damage per round).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Force </strong></em><strong>(6 MP). </strong>Force objects exist both materially and ethereally, affecting incorporeal creatures. They count as forcefields for determining stats.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ice.</strong></em> Elemental objects created of ice deal 1 point of damage per round to anyone who touches them (normal ice deals 1d6 damage per round).</p>\n<p><strong><em>Lava. </em></strong>Elemental objects created of lava deal 1 point of damage per round to anyone who touches them (normal lava deals a base of 1d6 damage per round of exposure). You can't create lava that surrounds and engulfs a creature, but it's certainly possible to create enough lava to push creatures into.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Life. </strong></em>You can create any sort of object of once-living matter, such as clothes, wooden desks, food, or boats. You could even create a corpse. (The market price of a corpse varies wildly depending on its nature.) Life is not actually created; \"life\" in this context menas \"organic matter.\" Food created in this way lasts 15 minutes (this duration does not need to be purchased with additional MP), and if it is consumed by a creature, it sustains the creature as though it were real in every respect.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Light.</strong></em> Light creates bright illumination in the spell's area of effect, and dim light for a further distance equal to half the spell's radius. For an additional 3 MP, the light can be made so bright that no shadows are cast, and any who see this bright light are subject to a MAG vital attack that inflicts the Blind condition.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Lightning.</strong></em> Elemental objects created of lightning deal 1 point of damage per round to anyone who touches them (normal lightning deals 1d6 damage per round).</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mist.</strong></em> A fog cloud obscures vision beyond 5'. A creature within 5' has concealment (-2d6 die penalty to hit it). Fog and mist can be dispersed by a moderate wind (11+ mph) in 4 rounds, or by a strong wind (21+ mph) in 1 round.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ooze </strong></em><strong>(3 MP).</strong> Ooze objects are semi-solid and can only be moved through at a rate of 5' per round. Melee attacks made in the area suffer a -1d6 die penalty to attack and damage rolls. Ranged attacks are impossible. The created object looks normal.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Shadow.</strong></em> Shadow creates darkness in the spell's area of effect, and dim light for a further distance equal to half the spell's radius. Creatures with darksight can see through this area normally. For an additional 1 MP, the darkness becomes impenetrable even to those with darksight, but does not have an additional dim light perimiter.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Sound. </em></strong>The spell creates actual, not illusory, sound somewhere within the spell's range that dissipates normally with distance. The sound is simple and repetitive, and is roughly as loud as four men talking. For an additional 1 MP, the sound can be as complex as a conversation, or simple musical quartet, and as loud as a crowd of shouting men. For 5 MP, the sound can be literally deafening, attacking all who hear it with a MAG vs Vital Defense check or becoming inflicted with the severe Deaf condition.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Void. </strong></em>The spell creates a vacuum, emptying the area of effect of liquids and gases. You can use this to snuff flames or suffocate creatures.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Water.</strong></em> The spell creates pure water. Water created in this way to fill one or more drinking vessels lasts 15 minutes (this duration does not need to be purchased by additional MP), and if it is drunk by a creature, it sustains the creature as though it were real in every respect.</p>\n<p><strong>Pocket Dimension. <em>Cost</em></strong><em> <strong>varies.</strong></em> You can use <em>create space</em> to create a pocket dimension, with an entrance big enough for you to walk through (though you may choose to make it smaller). You create the entrance anywhere within range. If you are inside, you can close or reopen the entrance with two actions. The area of effect you choose is the size of the pocket dimension, and also defines the cost in MP of the dimension--the MP cost of the pocket dimension is equal to twice the normal area of effect cost. Anything in the area of effect is effectively removed from the rest of the world. The interior of the pocket dimension is bare, and it ends without any apparent solid walls. Temperature and air within are the same as those without when the dimension is created. If the spell's duration ends, anything in the area of effect is expelled. The pocket dimension expires when the duration of the spell expires. You can include for free items using creation spells up to half the MP cost of the dimension itself (so if you created an 18 MP pocket dimension, it can include up to 9 MP worth of free creations).</p>\n<p><strong>Restrain.</strong> <em><strong>Cost varies.</strong></em> You inflict the Restrained condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the severe condition costs 4 MP. The condition is a temporary one which can be shaken off normally; however you can make it persistent by doubling this enhancement's MP cost.</p>","folder":"kh8BcWcbszee8u9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"7cKe5J9HEZ26Q640":3},"flags":{}}

MAG attribute check equal to 10 + the spell's MP cost, unless it targets an unwilling creature, in which case a MAG attack vs. the creature's Ranged, Mental, or Vital defense must be made instead or unless the spell performs an action for which an attribute check would normally be required (such as picking a lock). If two or more of these things apply, the highest is used. The minimum difficulty of a spell is 10.</p>\n<p>For example, a spell which simply creates a wall of stone across a passageway requires a MAG check equal to 10 + the spell's MP. The magic-user then deducts the cost of the spell from his current MP pool, and the spell is cast. Firing a bolt of fire at a goblin requireis the magic-user to make a ranged Magic attack at the goblin, and unlocking a locked door requires a check vs. the difficulty to pick the door's lock.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Spell Difficulty = 10 + MP Cost (or target's Defense, whichever is higher)</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Components.</strong> Spells require verbal (spoken) and somatic (physical) components, meaning that in order to cast a spell, the caster must be able to move and speak freely. Certain exploits can eliminate the need for these components.</p>\n<h2>Designing a Spell</h2>\n<p>Magic-users can create spells on the fly using the verb-noun (skill-secret) system. Spells combine skills (<em>evocation</em>, <em>compulsion</em>, <em>creation</em>, etc.) with secrets (<em>fire</em>, <em>air</em>, <em>blood</em>, <em>demon</em>, <em>undead</em>, <em>ice</em>, <em>plant</em>, <em>beast</em>, etc.) to create an effect defined by the skill(s) and secret(s) involved.</p>\n<p>A magic-user can use <em>compulsion</em> and the <em>secret of undead</em> to compel undead, but not to compel animals or summon undead. A spell might use the skill <em>abjuration</em> and the <em>secret of undead</em> to create an effect (<em>abjure</em> <em>undead</em>) which protects the caster from the undead. Similarly, a <em>create fire</em> spell can light a candle.</p>\n<h2>Basic Spell (Cantrip)</h2>\n<p>Choose a skill, add a secret which you know, and combine them to form an effect. The effect might be something like lighting a candle (<em>create fire</em>), cleaning a garment (<em>transform cloth</em>), or closing an irron door (<em>move metal</em>), and it is subject to attribute checks as normal (MAG is always used as the attribute). A spell that unlocks a door might require a MAG check versus teh lock's difficulty to pick it, even though lockpicking is normally accomplished with an AGI check. The action can cause a maximum of 1 point of damage; additional damage must be purchased separately.</p>\n<p>Each spell has a duration, range, and target (the target is either an area, a creature, or a point in space), plus a magical action which meets those criteria.</p>\n<p>A basic spell (cantrip), which costs 00 MP, is as follows. You may purchase increases to these stats (see the table above). You cannot spend more MP on one spell than your Magic attribute. Note that anybody with the skill and secret combination can cast a 0 MP spell, even if they have no Magic attribute. This represents the fact that magici permeates the world and can be manipulated by commonly known techniques, prayers, and rituals.</p>\n<h3>Basic Spells</h3>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Statistic</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Value at 0 MP</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Casting Time</strong></td>\n<td>1 action</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Duration</strong></td>\n<td>1 round</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Range</strong></td>\n<td>Touch or self</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Target or Area</strong></td>\n<td>One creature or object, a point in space, or one 5' square*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Effect</strong></td>\n<td>One action (e.g. open a door, light a candle, deal 1 point of damage, move 1 lb.)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><em>* Affecting unwilling creatures requires an attack roll using the caster's MAG attribute</em></p>\n<p>A basic spell uses the above statistics andn costs 0 MP. It can be enhanced with additional MP. Choose a range, duration, and target from the Improving a Spell table, above, and add on the MP cost for each.</p>\n<p>For example, using <em>move wood</em> to hold a wooden door 30' away closed for 1 minute would cost 5 MP. Lighting a candle 100' away using <em>create fire</em> would cost 4 MP. <em>Abjure water</em> for an hour to keep the rain off would cost 1 MP, or to keep the rain off a campfire within 30' for the same time would cost 3 MP (see the duration, abjuration exception to duration costs below).</p>\n<h2>Spell Aesthetics</h2>\n<p>It is up to the caster to decide what sensory form the spell takes. As long as your Game Master approves, your <em>abjure evil</em> spell might look like a shimmering suit of angelic armor, a faint holy glow, a wispy guardiant spirit, or even be completely discreet. Also, you can add mild enhancements to your spells, such as faint glowing lights, eeriei hissing noises, or a faint sense of dread felt by those in the area of effect. These enhancements have no statistical game effect, though they can add a lot of flavor, and make your spells more unique.</p>\n<h2>Spell Statistics</h2>\n<p>Magic-users can spend MP to improve any of the following statistics of their spells, according to the Improving a Spell table, above.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Duration.</strong></em> Duration also applies to delayed effects; the delay is counted as part of the duration.</p>\n<p><em>Duration, abjuration.</em> As a special exception to the costs for duration ienhancements, if you cast an Abjure spell with only Soak 1 (and range or target), and no other secrets or skilsl, you can purchase a one hour duration for 1 MP, and a one day duration for 2 MP. This can be used for longer term environmental protection.</p>\n<p><em>Duration and conditions. </em>Usually, a condition inflicted by a spell can be shaken off as normal, or the condition also ends when the spell duration ends, whichever comes first. You can pay double the cost of the appropriate effect to make the condition persistent for the spell's duration.</p>\n<p><em>Duration, concentration.</em> The spell lasts only as long as you maintain concentration on it. Concentrating takes one action per round, and you can only concentrate on one spell at a time. if the caster takes damage, a WIL check vs. the damage amount is required to maintain concentration.</p>\n<p><em>Duration, spread.</em> Effects can be spread over a period of time rather than happening instantly. For example 10d6 damage could be 10d6 damage all in one round, or 1d6 damage per round for 10 rounds. You may divide these damage dice (or ability drain, aging, and other effects) however you choose across the spell's duration. If you divide the effect <em>evenly</em> across the duration of a spell, you gain a -1 MP discount on the spell cost for every 3 rounds of duration (note that 10 rounds or less is equal to one minute and has a duration ost of 3 MP, which breaks even on cost. Higher cost durations provide greater savings). You cannot reduce the cost of the damage or effect to less than half its normal cost, however.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Target/Area. </strong></em>The effect must fit inside this area, which is noted as a diameter. Alternatively, double the value for a single line (5' wide, 5' high), or halve it for a cone. For spells with both range and target area, the range represents the center of the target area.</p>\n<p><em>Charging objects.</em> You can charge an object (such as an arrow or a sword) with a spell effect and use it as a ranged delivery mechanism. The duration begins when the spell is cast. You may choose a trigger (continuous, when the arrow hits, if the door is walked through by a goblin, etc.)</p>\n<p><em><strong>Casting Time (Reduction). </strong></em>Spells normally take 1 action to cast. By increasing the casting time, you can reduce their cost. You cannot reduce a spell's cost by more than 50% by increasing the casting time; neither can you reduce it to 0 MP. To cast a spell faster than 1 action, you need to take certain exploits, such as Signature Spell.</p>","folder":"0yfBEYzOgvoOjUQm","sort":200000,"permission":{"default":2,"7cKe5J9HEZ26Q640":3},"flags":{}}
{"_id":"BLZjiPtV7aP38reD","name":"Abjure","content":"<p><strong>Secrets:</strong> [self], [creature], [element], or [virtue]</p>\n<p>Abjuration spells can provide numerous types of defenses. Most abjuration spells defend individual creatures or objects, but you can create a spell that limits the movements of creatures into or out of an area, enhance Defense, grant damage resistance, or restrict the movements of certain creatures.</p>\n<p>Abjuration also includes the suppression or dispelling of magical effects.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>An <em>abjure</em> cantrip can grant 1 point of Soak against a specific damage type for up to one round. This is enough to provide basic environmental protection against non-extreme conditions.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Breaching. <em>Cost 2 MP per 1d6.</em></strong> This gives the target a +1d6 die bonus per 2 MP to attribute checks made to resist or breach a spell effect of the specified type.</p>\n<p><strong>Dispel Magic. <em>Cost varies.</em></strong> You can only dispel an effect if its area of effect is within range. You must devote the same amount of MP to the Dispel Magic effect, in addition to MP paid for range, area of effect, duration, etc, as the caster of the spell you are trying to dispel. The more MP you spend, the more powerful effects you can dispel. The check is a Magic check directly opposed by the caster's Magic check. In many cases, the caster's Magic check may have been made previously, and should be recorded as the difficulty of the effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Antimagic. <em>Cost 5 MP.</em></strong> You can create an antimagic area, making it difficult or impossible for all magic to work within. You must spend a minimum of 5 MP to create antimagic, in addition to area of effect, range, and duration. You make a Magic check as normal, and any spells or effects cast within that area must exceed that check as a difficulty value or have that magic countered. Whenever any spell or effect enters the area, or its area of effect intersects the antimagic area, its controller makes the check against this effective difficulty benchmark. Obviously an antimagic area will not suppress itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted Antimagic. <em>Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> As Antimagic, except that you choose a single magical skill and the antimagic effect only applies to spells which use that skill. You can therefore create a cheaper anti-scrying area or other specific defense.</p>\n<p><strong>Hedging.<em> Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> You must declare a creature type (fey, goblinoid, beast, etc.) or virtue (such as Good or Evil). Creatures with the declared type or virtue who try to enter the area of effect or try to target Mental Defense of creatures within the area are subject to a MAG vs Mental Defense attack; if it succeeds, the hedged creature cannot enter the protected area for one minute. Every minute it can make on attempt; if the creature fails, it is stuck outside for at least the next minute. This effect prevents the creature from making melee attacks into the area, but it can still use ranged attacks and spells which don't target Mental Defense.</p>\n<p><strong>Hedging, All.<em> Cost 2 MP.</em></strong> As Hedging, but it applies to all creatures. This uses <em>abjure self</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Hedging, Enduring.<em> Cost 3 MP.</em></strong> You can only use this option in combination with Hedging or Hedging, All. Affected creatures only get one chance every day to enter the area, rather than once per minute. Of course, if the duration is less than a day, this benefit is slightly reduced.</p>\n<p><strong>Hedging, Greater.<em> Cost 2 MP.</em></strong> YOu can only use this option in combination with Hedging or Hedging, All. None of the hedged creature's attacks, spells, or abilities can cross into the area of effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Shielding. <em>Cost 1 MP per +2 Defense.</em></strong> This a deflection ability; attacks of the secret's type are diverted away from the target. Affected creatures gain a bonus to their Defense against any selected creature type equal to the MP spent. To gain Defense against all creature types, the cost is 1 MP/+1 Defense and uses <em>abjure self</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Withstanding.<em> Cost 1 MP per +2 Soak.</em></strong> This enables the target to withstand the damage type of the secret; it does not deflect it away. Affected creatures gain a bonus to their Soak score vs. any selected damage type equal to the MP spent. To gain Soak against all damage types, the cost is 1 MP per +1 Soak instead, and the spell uses <em>abjure self</em>.</p>","folder":"kh8BcWcbszee8u9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"7cKe5J9HEZ26Q640":3},"flags":{}}

When the spell ends, the target reverts to its original form, though damage taken while transformed endures. You must use the secret of the new form.</p>\n<p>Items and creatures transformed into larger objects or creatures must fit within the area of effect in their new form. You cannot use a transform spell as a directly offensive spell that is unavoidable: you cannot turn the air over a creature into a metal block to crush it, nor can you turn the air around it into stone.</p>\n<p>When transformed into a creature, the target gains the new form's physical attributes, but not its mental attributes. Creatures keep their original mind, personalityk, and memories. If you transform a creature into another creature, its gear adapts to an appropriate form if there is one. Other items are subsumed into the new form, such as weapons if the form has no hands with which to wield them.</p>\n<p>For objects, the total MP you spend determines the maximum gold con value of items you can produce at a rate of 300 gc per MP.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A <em>transform</em> cantrip can change the color of an object or target, or make other minor cosmetic changes, for up to one round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The \"sescret\" part of a transformation spell is the resultant form, not the starting form. Transforming a floor from stone to ice is transform ice, not transform stone.</p>\n<p><strong>Animate. <em>Cost 2 MP per die. </em></strong>Transform an object into a creature. The object gains a mind and intelligence appropriate to its new form, although the highest LOG, WIL, or CHA attribute it can gain is 3. The cost is 2 MP for each die in the creature's maximum dice pool.</p>\n<p><strong>Bulk Transform. <em>Cost varies. </em></strong>Rather than simply changing a surface (as in Difficult Terrain), this transforms bulk material in 5' cubes. The effect must fit within the spell's area, but in addition the spell costs 3 MP per 5' cube. This also applies to large structures such as castle walls, or to digging out ground (by transforming stone to air or something similar) for the duration of the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>De-Animate. <em>Cost 8 MP. </em></strong>Transform a creature into an object. To transform an unwilling subject, you must spend an additional 6 MP. This includes the ability to turn creatures to stone (petrification).</p>\n<p><strong>Difficult Terrain. <em>Cost 0 MP. </em></strong>Most terrain transformations are able to create difficult terrain. Difficult terrain halves a creature's Speed unless it has an ability which allows it to move normally in such terrain. Difficult terrain can be caused by snow (ice), mud (ooze or earth), rubble (earth), swamp (water), deep undergrowth (plant), and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Elemental Damage. <em>Cost 0 or 1 MP. </em></strong>Damage caused by transformed terrain can do up to 1 point of damage for free. By spending 1 MP, the damage can be increased to 1d6 damage of the appropriate type. This damage is automatic, and requires no attack roll. For even more damage, evocation spells must be used instead. Elements useful for damaging effects include lava, acid, plants (thorns), earth (jagged ground), and so on.</p>\n<p><strong>Enlarge/Shrink. <em>Cost 4 MP per size category.</em></strong> You can enlarge or shrink an object or creature.</p>\n<p><strong>Immobilize. <em>Cost 5 MP. </em></strong>An immobilized creature suffers the severe Mobility status when it enters or starts its turn in the area. It can shake this off as normal. An immobilized creature cannot move from its spot on its own power (including flight), but is not paralyzed and can take actions normally. A creature might be immobilized by sticky mud (earth), ooze, grasping plants, or even freezing ice.</p>\n<p><strong>Slick. <em>Cost 2 MP. </em></strong>Slick areas are more slippery even than slippery areas. While a slippery area is merely difficult terrain (half Speed), a slick area is also almost impossible to stand on. Creatures can move safely across slick terrain at a Speed of 1. If they move faster than this, they must make a Difficult [16] AGI check or fall prone, ending their movement for that action. Note that slick areas are difficult terrain, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Split. <em>Cost varies. </em></strong>You can split the target into multiple entities (1 MP for each). If transforming a target into multiple creatures, the total cost is that used for the Transform Creature enhancement. They all recombine when the spell ends as long as at least one is left.</p>\n<p><strong>Transform Creature. <em>Cost 2 MP per die.</em></strong> Transform a creature into another creature. The target is transformed into a creature of the specified type. To transform an unwilling subject, you must spend an additional 6 MP. The cost is 2 MP for each die in the new creature's maximum dice pool (minimum 2 MP).</p>\n<p><strong>Transform Element. <em>Cost 1 MP per 300 gc value or by size.</em></strong> For example, this can transform scraps of wood into a wagon wheel. This also enables the object's new form to be of a different material. Use the value or size of the object, whichever is larger.</p>\n<p><strong>Water Breathing. <em>Cost 1</em></strong><em> <strong>MP. </strong></em> The target is able to breathe normally underwater. For 2 MP, the target doesn't need to breathe at all for the spell's duration.</p>\n<p>Note that the maximum depth/height of a transform effect that alters terrain is 5'.

If there are several different things of the chosen type within the area of effect, you are aware of roughly how many there are, and can concentrate on each one by one to determine its location.</p>\n<p><strong>Dowsing, Specific.<em> Cost 3 MP.</em></strong> As Dowsing, except you choose a specific object or creature you would be able to identify if you saw it, and you sense the direction to it.</p>\n<p><strong>History Reading.<em> Cost 5 MP.</em></strong> If you have a creature or object available, you can use this ability to see an overview of the history of the subject. When you make this divination, choose a span of time in history you want to read through. The shorter the span of time, the more specific the details are, and the longer the span, the more general. If you do a reading for a sword's history in the past week, you will see what battles it has been used in, and who it has killed, but if you try to read the past hundred years on it you will likely just learn the vague identities of its owners. Using the <em>secret of magic</em>, this enhancement can be used to identify a magical item: name, effects, and methods of activation.</p>\n<p><strong>Oracle.<em> Cost 2 MP.</em></strong> Questions are asked of an entity, whether local or extraplanar. You can ask a nearby tree or a bird, or you can try to contact distant planar entities. You cannot ask the same question through a divination in the same 24 hour period. YOu receive a short answer to your question. If the question is direct, you will likely receive a simple \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"neither\" answer. If the question is complex, the answer will be cryptic. The question must relate to the present (within a minute); to ask questions about the past or future, and additional 2 MP must be spent, and to ask question about the distant past or future, an additional 5 MP must be spent.</p>","folder":"kh8BcWcbszee8u9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"7cKe5J9HEZ26Q640":3},"flags":{}}

{"_id":"bi7emfKtRAIUSozQ","name":"Illude","content":"<p><strong>Secrets:</strong> none</p>\n<p>Illusion magic is a little different from other magical skills. Unlike those, illusion magic requires no secret--it is the art of deception and fakery. It may mimic a secret, but it is not real. For this reason, these spells are cast without an associated secret, and are available to any with the <em>illusion</em> skill.</p>\n<p>You create some sort of sensory illusion, which can be any size up to the size of the area of effect. An illusion can create an image or hide something (invisibility). Invisibility is basically a visual illusion of nothingness.</p>\n<p>Once you set the illusion, it remains the same. If you are within range, you can spend an action concentrating to make slight changes to the illusion or move it, but the general theme must remain the same, and the illusion cannot move beyond the area of effect. You can automatically disbelieve this illusion if you want.</p>\n<p>The basic cost of an illusion is determined by its size (the area of effect that comprises the illusion) plus a modifier for its quality. You can build the illusion out of various sensory components.</p>\n<h3>Disbelief</h3>\n<p>Illusions do not require an attack roll against creatures, but a Magic check should be rolled to determine the quality of the illusion. If a creature has reason to suspect an illusion is not real, it can make an opposed INT check vs the pre-rolled Magic check to discern its true nature. If a creature receives actual proof that an illusion is not real (an ally falls through an illusory wall, for example, or an invisible creature attacks the observer), it automatically disbelieves it. Disbelieving an illusion does not remove it; disbelief merely makes its illusory nature apparent to the viewer.</p>\n<h3>Bundled Senses</h3>\n<p>When combining multiple illusion types (visual, olfactory, audio, etc.) you can \"bundle\" the effects to save some MP, as each reinforces the others and helps mask imperfections. Each sense beyond the first is discounted by 1 MP, to a minimum of 1 MP.</p>\n<h3>Notes on Invisibility</h3>\n<p>Invisibility is a complex visual illusion. Camoflage can be achieved with a simple illusion (+1d6 to attempts at stealth), and a weak invisibility effect which has a visible distortion effect is an average illusion (+2d6 to attempts at stealth). Full invisibility as a complex illusion gives +3d6 to stealth attempts, and, of course, renders the target completely invisible (a failed stealth attempt or a disbelieved invisibility illusion--such as if the invisible creature attacks the observer--means that the viewer knows where the invisible creature is due to other clues--sound, moving items, tracks, being stabbed in the face, etc. but can't actually see it).</p>\n<p>Other illusions which mask various senses contribute to invisibility. An illusion that masks all five senses makes the target completely undetectable by normal means: a creature so well concealed doesn't need to roll stealth checks.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>An <em>illusion</em> cantrip can create a small, clearly illusory effect for up to one round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Audio Illusion, Average.<em> Cost 3 MP.</em></strong> Creating an average sound can make noise as loud as a small crowd of shouting men, with one or two articulate sounds. Thus, you could have a simple song with a few instruments, or a conversation. Hiding an average sound can make a roar sound like a soft quack, make one conversation sound like a different one, or reduce the volume by a substantial amount (granting +1d6 to stealth attempts).</p>\n<p><strong>Audio Illusion, Complex.<em> Cost 5 MP.</em></strong> A complex sound can be as loud as a dragon's roar or an entire parade cheering, and all of it can be as articulate as you want, complete with subtle sounds like kids in the crowd whining to their moms, and the dragon's roar echoing properly in an opera house. Hiding a complex sound lets you turn any noise into practically anything else of the same volume or quieter. Complete silence is a complex audio illusion which grants +2d6 to stealth attempts.</p>\n<p><strong>Audio Illusion, Simple.<em> Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> Creating a simple sound could create any simple repeating sound, like a growl, laughter, or moan of wind, but nothing articulate. The volume can be no louder than four men talking. Hiding a simple sound could make speech sound like an indistinct murmur, or reduce the volume of a sound slightly.</p>\n<p><strong>Aura Illusion.<em> Cost 3 MP.</em></strong> An aura illusion enables you to create a fake magical aura, or to mask an existing aura.</p>\n<p><strong>Olfactory Illusion, Average. <em>Cost 3 MP.</em></strong> An average olfactory illusion could make the air smell like warm root beer, or make an illusory steak taste real. Hiding an average olfactory sensation would let you fool the scent and taste buds of any human except the finest connoisseurs, and could throw animals off your trail.</p>\n<p><strong>Olfactory Illusion, Complex.<em> Cost 6 MP.</em></strong> A complex olfactory illusion can be whatever you want, as complicated and subtle as you like. Similarly, hiding a complex olfactory sensation would let you turn any taste or smell into anything else that isn't very much more or less strong.</p>\n<p><strong>Olfactory Illusion, Simple.<em> Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> Creating a simple olfactory sensation can fake intense smells, like blood, sour milk, or ammonia. Hiding a simple olfactory sensation lets you conceal the distinct stench of rotting zombies, or hide your own body odor, but the new smell would be bland.</p>\n<p><strong>Reactive Illusion.<em> Cost 4 MP.</em></strong> You can make your illusion react on its own. For example, normally, you could have an illusion of a guard standing wtch, shifting occasionally in his stance and appearing to breathe, but not reacting to anyone else. With a simple reactive illusion, the guard would look at it and glower slightly at anyone who came by. A standard reactive illusion would let the guard respond to questions with disinterest. A complex reactive illusion would let the guard act exactly as you would want it to if you were there to direct it consciously.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactile Illusion, Average.<em> Cost 4 MP.</em></strong> An average tactile sensation could make someone feel they're being jostled by invisible people, or give a visual illusion of a cat a real texture. Hiding an average tactile sensation would let you make blood gushing from a wound feel like worms crawling across you, and could make a suit of armor feel like a fine royal robe.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactile Illusion, Complex.<em> Cost 8 MP.</em></strong> Creating a complex tactile sensation would let you make a person feel like he's on fire, and would put the finishing touches on an illusion of a beautiful nymph: warm, wet, and covered in fine sand particles from the bank of a stream. Hiding a complex tactile sensation would let you make a real object feel like it is intangible, and could turn a lover's embrace into the segmented coils of a demon leech.</p>\n<p><strong>Tactile Illusion, Simple.<em> Cost 2 MP.</em></strong> Creating a simple tactile sensation could make the air feel moist and heavy, or make you feel wet. Hiding a simple tactile sensation could make glass feel like sandpaper, give metal a wood grain, or make a fire feel cold. Hiding a tactile sensation won't stop a person from feeling pain, but it might confuse him as to how to avoid the injury.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Illusion, Average.<em> Cost 3 MP.</em></strong> Creating an average visual would let you create a bookshelf with a lot of books that look generally the same, make a ghostly glowing word appear in the air, or create a convincing orc warrior (though if you made several orc warriors, they'd all look alike). Hiding an average visual would allow you to blur your own image as you move, change the appearance of one person to resemble another person, or make an immobile object invisible.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Illusion, Complex.<em> Cost 5 MP.</em></strong> Creating a complex visual would let you make any sort of visual image, no matter how fine the details are. You could make the illusion of a full person, complete with distinctive markings, unique pieces of clohting, and an expressive demeanor. Hiding a complex visual can make things invisible even while moving, make a group of sneaking goblins look like harmless ducks, or make a worthless rock look like an ornate bejeweled porcelain egg. Attacks against a blurred creature have a -1d6 die penalty. Attacks against an invisible creature have a -2d6 die penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Visual Illusion, Simple.<em>Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> Creating a simple visual would let you make a fairly drab set of clothes, a wall with a repeating pattern of tiles, or a very rough approximation of a living creature. Hiding a simple visual would let you replace a complicated image with a simple one, like hiding a scar with smooth skin, hiding a secret door with flat stone, or turning an elaborate tapestry into a mono-color rug.</p>","folder":"kh8BcWcbszee8u9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"7cKe5J9HEZ26Q640":3},"flags":{}}

This does not paralyze the creature, however, so it can still take actions and defend itself normally. Anchor can be cast on the caster himself to make himself immovable.</p>\n<p><strong>Immobilize. <em>Cost 5 MP. </em></strong>The target gains the Restrained condition and is thus unable to move from its current spot. Additionally, the target cannot move from its spot using magical means of transport, like teleportation.

You could cause a wagon to roll forward on its wheels, make a taxadermied bird fly around, or make a chair skitter across the floor. You can also use it for simple manual tasks, such as untying knots or opening doors. You can only control the creature or object while it's within range. If the creature or object moves beyond the spell's range, the spell does not end, but you cannot control it until it enters range again. The size of the object you can move is given in the Common Enhancements table. Telekinesis requires concentration, and must have a duration of \"concentraion\" selected.</p>\n<p><strong>Telekinetic Thrust. <em>Cost 2 MP per 5'. </em></strong>This is a focused application of telekinesis. You make a ranged attack using your MAG attribute against a target creature as normal, and shove it 5' for each 2 MP you spend. it is an instantaneous effect, and cannot have a duration attached.

Evocations are what a caster uses to throw fire and lightning, blast her enemies, or wield ice and lightning as weapons. For this reason, evocations are popular among many mages.</p>\n<p>Note that in terms of damage types, good damage is usually referred to as holy damage, and evil damage is normally referred to as unholy damage. Death damage is usually referred to as necrotic damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>An <em>evocation</em> cantrip deals 1 point of damage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Elemental Damage. <em>Cost 1 MP; 2 MP per +2d6 damage.</em> </strong>All Evoke spells deal a base 1d6 points of damage of teh secret's type to all in the spell's area if you spend 1 MP. You can increase this damage to 2d6 by spending 2 MP instead, and thereafter by an additional 1d6 for each further 2 MP you spend. Note some elements have a bonus effect when you spend 2 or more MP:</p>\n<p><em><strong>Acid</strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em> Acid coats affected creatures and objects, continuing to deal 1 point of acid damage per round. The acid eventually becomes inert after a number of rounds equal to the MP spent, but it can also be washed off with about one gallon of water for every 5' square of area. A creature can scrape or wipe acid off itself or a comparably-sized object with two actions, though this usually ruins the scraping implement.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Air.</strong></em> Intense winds can knock affected creatures across the battlefield. All creatures affected by a single spell are knocked in the same direction, though if the spell has an area of effect you may knock creatures away from a chosen central point. Creatures in the area of effect successfully hit by the spell are blown back 5'. Swarms of tiny flying creatures are dispersed. Clouds of non-magical mist and smoke are dispersed automatically. Larger creatures are unaffected.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Fire. </strong></em>The spell's flames ignite flammable material. The area is illuminated with firelight each round. Only highly flammable materials, such as exposed oil or sheets of paper, catch fire, but for an additional +3 MP materials that can burn but need to be coaxed, such as logs, catch fire, and the flames do 1d6 damage to those who enter or start their turn in the area. Note that to mack a living creature catch fire, a critical hit is needed as normal.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Force. </strong></em>Force damage cannot affect inanimate objects. However, it harms incorporeal or intangible creatures normally. Force damage has no other side effects.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ice. </strong></em>The spell can freeze affected creatures and objects. Frozen objects become brittle, becoming vulnerable (1d6) to blunt damage. The freezing effect ends at the end of the spell's duration. Normally only tiny creatures and objects are affected in this manner, but for 2 extra MP it affects small objects and creatures, for 4 extra MP it affects medium objects and creatures, for 6 MP it affects large objects and creatures, and so on (2 MP per size category). The area within an area affected by an ice evocation becomes slippery.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Lava.</strong></em> Affected objects become dangerously hot (baking) for the spell's duration. Creatures are not burned in this way, but if they bear metal armor or weapons, they suffer 1d6 fire damage per round until the spell ends or they drop the metallic objects. This applies both to lava effects, and to general heaing which does not involve actual fire or flames.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Light.</strong></em> For an extra 3 MP, you can create a bright light that will blind those within the area on a successful attack roll. For 5 MP, the bright light will stun them.

Weaker compulsions let you set a specific task for the character to perform, while more powerful compulsions give you ongoing control of the creature's actions.</p>\n<p>If a creature is successfully affected by a compel spell, it obeys your commands to the best of its ability. Low-MP compel spells are language dependent, and thus creatures are allowed by obey the letter of your commands, rather than the spirit. The more powerful the spell, the more control you have, and the more complicated actions you can command.</p>\n<p>Each round, creatures can try to shake a compulsion off. Obviously suicidal commands are ignored, and dangerous acts grant a +1d6 bonus to the check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A <em>compel</em> cantrip can allow you to issue a simple one-word command to a target or send a one-word telepathic message to an ally.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Compulsion. <em>Cost varies.</em></strong> You inflict the Charmed condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the extreme condition costs 4 MP. The condition is a temporary one which can be shaken off normally; however, you can make it persistent by doubling this enchantment's MP cost (see page 176 of the OLD core rulebook).</p>\n<p><strong>Subtle Compulsion. <em>Cost 3 MP.</em></strong> The creature is unaware that it has been controlled, and cannot shake off the effect, which lasts for a set duration (which must be purchased). If the spell also contains charm enhancements, this enhancement also functions as the Subtle Charm enhancement. You only need to buy one. Without this enhancement, creatures will be aware that they are being affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Erase.<em> Cost varies.</em></strong> You inflict the @Item[lowGeXlXnOVBvse0]{Forgetful} condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the extreme condition costs 4 MP.</p>\n<p><strong>Message.<em> Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> As Send Emotion, but with speech; however, this does not allow you or the target creature to understand additional languages.</p>\n<p><strong>Communicate.<em> Cost 4 MP.</em></strong> As Message, but you can communicate clearly regardless of language.</p>\n<p><strong>Send Emotion.<em> Cost 0 MP.</em></strong> You can communicate simple concepts to creatures in the area of effect, like friendship or emotion, but you cannot communicate actual language. You can only communicate as long as the creature is within range. The creature can choose to reply in kind, but this gives you no power to know what it doesn't want to tell you. You can use this on willing targets to allow easy communication, but unwilling creatures require an attack roll as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Senselink.<em> Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> As Send Emotion, but you can sense whatever the creature is sensing, and you can impart your senses to it. Pain can be understood, but damage does not cross over this link.</p>\n<p><strong>Mind Modify. <em>Cost 4 MP.</em></strong> By concentrating, you can rewrite the creature's memory or knowledge. The knowledge or modification only lasts as long as the spell's duration, and you must about one round concentrating to change the creature's memory. You can choose to rewrite several pieces of simple information (password, the location he's ccurrently at, which way the prisoners went), or rewrite a complex piece of information (making a guard think he's an escapee, imparting knowledge equal to a skill rank or one spell, or changing his memory of the lyrics of a song), or modify the memory of a single event. What constitutes an event varies, but can include several related small events convering no more than a month.</p>\n<p><strong>Mind Read.<em> Cost 4 MP.</em></strong> By concentrating, you can deeply read the mind of the creature. Each round, you can either search for specific information (e.g., the name of a spy, the location of hidden treasure, the gate password) or simply browsing for interesting information. Browsing for general information normally garners nothing very urgent or secretive unless the creature was recently thinking about it, but gives you a broader sense of the creature's mind. You can only browse one creature at a time, but if there are multiple creatures in the area, you can look for specific information in all of them at once.</p>\n<p><strong>Mind Scan.<em> Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> By concentrating, you can \"overhear\" the thoughts of the creature. If there are multiple creatures in the area, you can focus on one at a time, or try to decipher out their thoughts all at once, like hearing one person in a crowded room. This does not give you the ability to understand the creature's language, but you can comprehend emotions and simple desires like fear or hunger regardless of language. The affected creature can attempt to shake this off each round.</p>\n<p><strong>Mindwipe.</strong><em> <strong>Cost 6 MP.</strong></em> You completely erase all the creature's memories and knowledge. You must concentrate for a full minute to accomplish this. The target must be within range for the entire modification. This only lasts for the duration of the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Shared Perception. <em>Cost 3 MP + 1 MP per additional sense.</em></strong> You can use the senses of a creature within the area of effect. The duration of the spell must be concentration, and you gain access to one of the creature's senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and/or touch. For each additional MP you spend, you gain access to one more sense, for a maxmimum of 6 MP for all five senses. However, any such sense you access replaces your own equivalent sense for the duration; this can render you effectively blind or deaf (as per the conditions). You also gain access to the creature's Perception score (and, if you have the appropriate sense linked, any additional specific Perception scores such as scent or hearing).</p>\n<p><strong>Telepathic Command. <em>Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> More powerful than a verbal command, you can instruct another creature using only your mind. You must use this enhancement to modify a verbal command enhancement.</p>\n<p><strong>Verbal Command. <em>Cost varies. </em></strong>The target must be able to hear and understand you. For 0 MP you can give the target a one or two word command, which it obeys, though it may distort your intent. For 2 MP your command can be one or two sentences long, detailing a single slightly complex task. Once you finish casting the spell, the command doesn't take effect until you finish telling the target, so you might need to rush if the target is threatening you. For 5 MP the command can be as long or complex as you want. The more complex the command, often the more easily the target can distort its intention, but the main limiting factor is how much time the spell lasts. Commands can only be instantaneous spells. For longer preiods of control, use the Compulsion enhancement.</p>","folder":"kh8BcWcbszee8u9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"7cKe5J9HEZ26Q640":3},"flags":{}}

Only affected creatures can take actions in this free round. You cannot harm creatures, and spells you cast simply tick down their duration with no effect. You can move unattended objects, run away, or cast spells to affect yourself which will function normally. For each additional 2 MP you spend, affected creatures each gain another one round, which can be used at any time.</p>\n<p><strong>Dilated Time. <em>Cost 3 MP.</em></strong> All creatures, objects, and spell effects in the area age one round. Their effects still occur, so an ongoing spell deals damage for the round, a fire burns one round worth of fuel, and poison runs its course one round faster. Likewise a spell will end one round sooner. For spells that grant an attribute check to resist on a round by round basis, use the result of the last-made check to determine effects. Things within the area of effect cannot influence those outside, so if a dilated fuse sets off a bomb in the area, the explosion will be limited to the area of effect. Unwilling creatures in the area of effect must be subject to an attack vs. Mental Defense or they are unaffected. For 6 MP, things age 5 rounds; for 10 MP they age 5 minutes, and for 15 MP they age half a day.</p>\n<p><strong>Grow Plant.<em> Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> Non-sentient plants in the area of effect age one day. You can purchase this enhancement mlutiple times. This effect is natural growth, and is not undone when the spell's duration ends. Indeed, the spell's duration doesn't matter for this effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Pocket of Time. <em>Cost 15 MP.</em></strong> The area of effect and everything inside it gain extra time, equal to the spell's duration. The outside world stands still while the area of effect speeds along. Anything leaving the area of effect loses the effect of this extra time, and returns to the normal flow of time just slightly outside the area. Spell effects created during this time pocket do not continue after this spell ends, so it is useful for resting and healing, but not for actual offense or defense. Unwilling creatures in the area of effect must be subject to an attack vs Mental Defense. If unsuccessful, they are shunted to outside the area of effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Slow Time.<em> Cost varies.</em></strong> You inflict the @Item[MesLpx661zOthtD6]{Slowed} condition. The standard condition costs 2 MP, while the extreme condition costs 4 MP. The condition is a temporary one which can be shaken off normally; however, you can make it persistent by doubling this enhancement's MP cost (see page 176 of the OLD core rulebook).</p>\n<p><strong>Time Hop.<em> Cost 4 MP per round.</em></strong> The Time Hop enhancement lets you skip forward in the time 1 round per 4 MP spent. Traveling backward in time is impossible by default; meddling with history is only available in campaigns where the GM wants to introduce the possibility. One time during the spell's duration, affected creatures can time hop once, using two actions to do so. When a creature time hops, it vanishes, then reappears in the same place after the alloted time passes. For the creature, the transition is instantaneous. If the creature would reappear in a solid object, it instead is shunted to the nearest suitably large open space and takes 2d6 blunt damage.</p>\n<p><strong>Timeless.<em> Cost 15 MP.</em></strong> The area of effect is removed from time for the spell's duration. Nothing inside the area of effect changes or can be affected.</p>\n<p><strong>Ghost Touch. <em>Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> The attack can harm incorporeal creatures as easily as corporeal ones. If use on a creature, the creature gains the benefits to natural attacks and attacks made without weapons, including spell attacks. If used on an object or weapon, the object grants the benefit to all attacks made with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Phasing Attack.<em> Cost 3 MP.</em></strong> The attack selectively passes through certain types of matter harmlessly, and it only hurts those you want to strike. It ignores armor and shield Soak values, and deals damage normally. If used on a creatures, the creature gains the benefits to natural attacks and attacks made without weapons, including spell attacks. If used on an object or weapon, the object grants the benefit to all attacks made with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Phasing Movement.<em> Cost 9 MP.</em></strong> This allows you to move through any sort of solid objects as easily as through air, but you are not ethereal and can still be harmed by attacks normally. While traveling through these materials, you can choose to move across any part of the material as if it were solid, allowing you to walk across mud, or climb upward or downward through stone at up to 45 degree angles. You can move at up to half yoru base speed through solid objects. You still cannot breathe while inside a solid object.</p>\n<p><strong>Spirit Wander. <em>Cost 1 MP.</em></strong> Spirit Wander simply lets the creature release its spirit from its body. The spirit can travel at the creature's base speed, vaguely observing the world around it as if through a thin curtain. It can sense the presence, number, and general size of all creatures present, but it can only see clearly or communicate with other spirit wanderers and can in no way influence the real world. The distance the spirit can travel from its body is the same as the normal range of the spell. The creature is aware vaguely of the state of its real body, and cna return at any time by using two actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Possession.<em> Cost 5 MP.</em></strong> The Possession enhancement allows you (or the affected creature) to move its soul into the body of another. First, your (or the creature's) spirit must leave its own body. You may then choose to enter some sort of receptacle, generally called a \"magic jar.\" With two actions you can try to possess any living creature your spirit touches, or that is within range of the magic jar. You make a MAG vs Mental Defense attack, and if you fail, your spirit stays out of its body, and each successive attempt to enter that creature takes a -1d6 die penalty. If the attack succeeds, your spirit enters its body. If you used a magic jar, the creature's soul is trapped in the jar, but otherwise, its spirit automatically enters your own body. A magic jar costs at least 100 gc to purchase or make. Alternatively, your own body can be the magic jar, in which case your spirits switch places.</p>\n<p>While in the body of another, you can freely move beyond the normal range of the spell.</p>\n<p>When the spell ends, your spirit leaves the host and tries to return to its own body, and the host's soul returns to its body. However, you cannot leave the host if neither your original body nor the magic jar is within range. If the spell ends and you can not reach your original body, you die. This likewise happens to the soul of the host if its body is out of range when the spell ends.</p>\n<p>If either body dies during the spell, both souls must make a <em>Difficult [16]</em> WIL check or die. If both succeed, whoever rolled highest gains permanent possession of the remaining body. If one fails, the other gains possession. If both fail, the remaining body simply dies.</p>\n<p>If the spell is made permanent before its duration ends, however, the souls become comfortable residents of their current locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Projection.<em> Cost 3 MP.</em></strong>  The Projection enhancement allows you to send your soul out of your body yet still influence the real world. Your spirit is visible and has all the same qualities as your real body, except that by spending two actions you can return to simply a spirit state, unseen and intangible. Also with two actions you can return to your body. You still cannot move beyond the spell's normal range. If your spirit body is slain, your spirit returns to your body and are reduced to 0 Health. If this spell is combined with a teleport spell, the range you can roam is determined from the point you teleport to.</p>\n<p><strong>Teleport.<em> Cost 5 MP.</em></strong> One time in the spell's duration, the affected creature can teleport up to anywhere within the spell's area. This requires two actions. A creature that teleports can bring along any objects it carries.</p>\n<p>If you teleport to somewhere out of your line of sight, you must make a LOG check (see the table below). If you fail, you end up off course bu d66% of the distance traveled.</p>\n<p><strong>At-Will Teleport.<em> Cost 9 MP.</em></strong> Folr an extra 9 MP on top of your Teleport effect, you can get the At Will enhancement. This gives you the ability to activate the teleport as many times as you want during the spell's duration. If you individually target this spell, the affected creature or creatures can teleport independently. Each teleportation takes just a single action.</p>\n<h3>Teleport Difficulty</h3>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Familiarity with Destination</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Check Difficulty</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Familiar</td>\n<td><em>Routine [10]</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seen</td>\n<td><em>Difficult [16]</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Description Only</td>\n<td><em>Strenuous [21]</em></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p> </p>","folder":"kh8BcWcbszee8u9e","sort":0,"permission":{"default":2,"7cKe5J9HEZ26Q640":3},"flags":{}}
